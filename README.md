I am Alan Deardorff, retired professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.  My specialty is international trade and trade policy.

I'm hoping to use GitHub as a location to permanently store two projects  that I created on my website at University of Michigan, so that they will remain available after I am no longer able to maintain them.  The projects are Deardorffs' Glossary of International Economics, and Family Tree of Trade Economists.  Both are projects that I began around the year 2000 and have continued to update and add to every year since then.  It is currently 2025.

I don't have them here yet, but if you want to access them on my UM website, use the following links:  <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/">Glossary</a>, <a href="https://websites.umich.edu/~alandear/tree/INDEX.HTM">Tree</a>
